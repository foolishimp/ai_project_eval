# Rule-Based Evaluation Matrix

## Non-LLM Scoring System

This provides deterministic scoring based on specific, measurable criteria without requiring LLM interpretation.

### Technical Complexity Scoring Rules

- 1-2 new integrations required
- Standard AI/ML libraries (scikit-learn, etc.)
- Team has 80%+ relevant experience

**Score 3 (Medium)**:
- Custom development required
- 3-5 system integrations
- Requires specialized AI/ML skills
- Team has 50-80% relevant experience

**Score 4 (High)**:
- Cutting-edge technology required
- 5+ complex system integrations
- Domain-specific AI/ML expertise needed
- Team has 20-50% relevant experience

**Score 5 (Very High)**:
- Experimental/research-level technology
- Novel integration approaches required
- Multiple specialized domains needed
- Team has <20% relevant experience

### Resource Requirements Scoring Rules

**Score 1 (Very Low)**:
- 1-2 team members
- Uses existing infrastructure

- Multiple external specialists needed

### Implementation Risk Scoring Rules

**Score 1 (Very Low)**:
- No regulatory requirements
- Standard security practices
- High user acceptance expected
- No external dependencies

**Score 2 (Low)**:
- Minor compliance considerations
- Enhanced security measures

- Few external dependencies

**Score 3 (Medium)**:
- Some regulatory oversight
- Specialized security requirements
- Moderate change management needed
- Several external dependencies

**Score 4 (High)**:
- Significant compliance requirements
- Complex security/audit needs
- Substantial user resistance possible
- Many external dependencies

**Score 5 (Very High)**:
- Heavy regulatory oversight
- Mission-critical security requirements
- High resistance/change difficulty
- Critical external dependencies

### Business Impact Scoring Rules

**Score 1 (Very Low)**:
- Minimal efficiency improvement
- Limited user base affected
- Nice-to-have functionality

- Significant operational transformation
- Organization-wide impact
- Strategic business enablement
- Major competitive advantage

**Score 5 (Very High)**:
- Revolutionary business change
- Industry-level impact
- Completely new business models
- Market leadership position

### Scalability Potential Scoring Rules

**Score 1 (Very Low)**:
- Single, specific use case
- Limited to one team/department
- Difficult to extend
- No reusability

**Score 2 (Low)**:
- Few similar use cases
- Department-specific application
- Minor extension possibilities
- Limited reusability

**Score 3 (Medium)**:
- Multiple department applications
- Some cross-functional potential
- Moderate extension capabilities
- Good reusability

**Score 4 (High)**:
- Enterprise-wide applications
- Cross-industry potential
- High extension capabilities
- Excellent reusability

**Score 5 (Very High)**:
- Platform/ecosystem potential
- External monetization possible
- Exponential scaling opportunities
- Maximum reusability

### Implementation Timeline Scoring Rules

**Score 1 (Very Low)**:
- Extended development cycle
- Complex deployment requirements
- Long validation periods
- Delayed value realization

**Score 2 (Low)**:
- Long development cycle
- Gradual rollout required
- Standard validation needs
- Moderate time to value

**Score 3 (Medium)**:
- Standard development cycle
- Phased implementation possible
- Normal validation requirements
- Reasonable time to value

**Score 4 (High)**:
- Rapid development possible
- Quick deployment options
- Minimal validation needed
- Fast time to value

**Score 5 (Very High)**:
- Immediate implementation
- Instant deployment
- No validation barriers
- Immediate value realization

## Usage Instructions

1. **For each dimension**, answer the specific criteria questions
2. **Match the responses** to the scoring rules above
3. **Assign the corresponding score** (1-5)
4. **Apply the weights** from evaluation_criteria.md
5. **Calculate final scores** using the standard formula

This eliminates subjective LLM interpretation while maintaining evaluation consistency.
